## Introduction
INFRA-3DRC-Dataset is the public dataset generated using smart infrastructure setup. It consists of calibrated, time-synchronized, and annotated sensor frames of 3D autotmotive radar and RGB mono-camera. Each radar frame contains point-wise annotation and each camera image is annotated in form of 2D bounding box(es). For completeness, calibrated and time-synchronized 3D lidar sensor frames are also included in the dataset, but these frames are not annotated.  
<br />
At present, dataset consists of 27 scenes recorded from different geographical locations in different light conditions - day light, twilight and night. STATISTICS TO WRITE
